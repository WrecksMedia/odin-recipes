        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 1/4 cups bread flour (500 grams)</li>
                <li>1 rounded teaspoon dry yeast (3.5 grams)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons water (400 ml)</li>
                <li>generous 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (20 ml), plus 2 teaspoons more to oil container</li>
                <li>rounded 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt or kosher salt (10 grams)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ounces Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups prepared pizza sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide. Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the seam side is down.</li>
                <li>Shape back into a neat ball with damp hand. Transfer dough into an oiled container, rub with a few drops of olive oil, and cover. Refrigerate for an additional 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand on the counter for 1 hour to come to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes; remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (250 degrees C). Oil a sheet pan generously with olive oil. A sheet of parchment paper can be placed on the pan to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue stretching and pressing into place.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly.</li> 
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.</li>
                <li>Spread crust with sauce, scatter over sausage and vegetables, sprinkle with mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese, and finish with a dusting of Parmesan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack; let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.</li>
            </ol>
